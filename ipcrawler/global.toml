# Global Wordlists and Settings
# ========================================
# Wordlists used by scanning tools
# Install wordlists: sudo apt install seclists wordlists
#
# Path Resolution:
# - Relative paths (e.g., 'wordlists/file.txt') are resolved relative to global.toml location
# - Absolute paths (e.g., '/usr/share/seclists/...') are used as-is
# - ipcrawler/wordlists/ contains local fallback wordlists

# Used by: feroxbuster, gobuster, dirsearch, ffuf, dirb

# Configured wordlist path (may exist on target machine)

# Alternative: Use custom wordlist anywhere on system
# directory-wordlist = '/home/user/custom-wordlists/my-directory-list.txt'

# ========================================
# DNS/Subdomain Scanning Wordlists  
# ========================================
# Used by: subdomain enumeration tools

# ========================================
# LFI (Local File Inclusion) Wordlists

# Note: Smaller wordlists = faster scans
# - directory-list-2.3-small.txt: ~87K entries (recommended)
# - directory-list-2.3-medium.txt: ~220K entries (thorough)
# - subdomains-top1million-5000.txt: ~5K entries (fast)
# - subdomains-top1million-110000.txt: ~110K entries (comprehensive)
# - burp-parameter-names.txt: ~6K parameter names (LFI discovery)
# - LFI-Jhaddix.txt: ~900 LFI payloads (comprehensive LFI testing)
# - dirbuster.txt: ~116K entries (local fallback wordlist)
#
# Path Examples:
# Relative to global.toml:        'wordlists/my-list.txt'
# Absolute system path:           '/usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/big.txt'
# User home directory:            '/home/username/wordlists/custom.txt'
# Current working directory:      './my-wordlists/list.txt'

# ========================================
# Configuration Examples for Different Environments
# ========================================
#
# For Kali Linux with SecLists installed:
# directory-wordlist = '/usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-2.3-small.txt'
# subdomain-wordlist = '/usr/share/seclists/Discovery/DNS/subdomains-top1million-5000.txt'
# username-wordlist = '/usr/share/seclists/Usernames/top-usernames-shortlist.txt'
# password-wordlist = '/usr/share/seclists/Passwords/darkweb2017-top100.txt'
#
# For custom wordlist directories:
# directory-wordlist = '/opt/wordlists/custom-directories.txt'
# subdomain-wordlist = '/opt/wordlists/custom-subdomains.txt'
#
# For portable installations (relative paths):
# directory-wordlist = 'wordlists/custom-dirs.txt'
# subdomain-wordlist = 'wordlists/custom-subs.txt'
#
# For HTB/CTF environments with custom lists:
# directory-wordlist = '/home/kali/wordlists/custom-web-dirs.txt'
# vhost-wordlist = '/home/kali/wordlists/custom-vhosts.txt'
