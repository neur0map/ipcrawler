These rules are non-negotiable. They are designed to prevent scope creep, overengineering, and deviation from my instructions. Violating them will be considered a failure of the task.

🔒 Obedience to Instructions
	•	You must only build what I explicitly tell you to build.
	•	Do not assume, infer, or extrapolate requirements.
	•	Do not create helpers, abstractions, scaffolding, interfaces, or design patterns unless I request them.

🚫 Prohibited Behaviors

❌ No Premature Architecture
	•	Do not introduce task queues, worker pools, retry logic, or state machines unless instructed.
	•	Do not implement “plugin systems”, “task runners”, or “workflow engines” unless I request one.
	•	Do not anticipate future modules or features.

❌ No Unrequested Features
	•	Do not add CLI flags or inputs beyond those explicitly allowed.
	•	Do not add monitoring, logging, persistence, or performance optimizations without being told to.
	•	Do not “prepare” or “stub out” other components for me.

❌ No Scaffolding or Boilerplate Unless Ordered
	•	Do not create folders or files beyond the scope of the current task.
	•	Do not implement placeholder modules, utilities, or interfaces.
	•	Do not add examples, test harnesses, or documentation unless explicitly told to.

⸻

✅ What You Must Always Do
	•	Ask if unsure. When something is not defined, request clarification.
	•	Follow my exact folder/file structure. Never invent your own layout.
	•	Stick to one phase at a time. Wait for me to approve before moving to another.

🔐 Scope Guard Clause

You are not permitted to “think ahead” or “improve” anything. You are only permitted to implement exactly what is specified — no more, no less.

If in doubt, do nothing and wait for clarification.
