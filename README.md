## About

As a cybersecurity and network engineering student, I built ipcrawler to solve a personal frustration: running the same reconnaissance commands repeatedly during CTF competitions. Instead of maintaining sprawling cheatsheets and copy-pasting commands, I wanted a single tool that could orchestrate multiple scanners intelligently.

This project is developed with AI assistance as part of my learning journey. It's designed to be more approachable than existing tools like autorecon (Python) or reconnoitre (Go), especially for those just starting with security assessments.

## Why ipcrawler?

- **CTF-Focused**: Built specifically for Hack The Box and CTF scenarios
- **YAML Workflows**: Define reusable scan profiles for different machine types
- **Parallel Execution**: Run multiple tools simultaneously with smart concurrency
- **Tool Chaining**: Automatically pipe outputs between tools (e.g., naabu ‚Üí nmap)
- **Interactive Summary Viewing**: Beautiful markdown reports with terminal window integration
- **Beginner Friendly**: Clear output, simple configuration, minimal learning curve

## Why Rust?

The journey to Rust wasn't straightforward. This project began in Python, but as it grew in complexity, silent errors became increasingly difficult to track down and debug. The additional configuration overhead required to run on Hack The Box machines (requiring source code cloning instead of simple binary deployment) further complicated the development process.

I then explored Go for its excellent binary compilation features, but encountered the same silent error issues that plagued the Python version. When attempting to build a TUI interface, Go presented inconsistent failures that were difficult to diagnose‚Äîespecially challenging for someone learning to code with AI assistance.

**Rust solved these core problems:**
- **Compile-time Error Detection**: Rust's compiler catches errors before runtime, eliminating the silent failures that plagued previous versions
- **Memory Safety**: No segfaults or memory leaks to debug in production
- **Excellent Concurrency**: Built-in support for safe parallel and concurrent execution, crucial for running multiple scanning tools simultaneously
- **Single Binary Deployment**: Easy distribution and installation on CTF environments
- **Strong Community**: Large, helpful community with extensive documentation and AI-friendly error messages

While Rust has a steep learning curve and can be challenging for AI-assisted development, the compiler's detailed error messages and the community's focus on helpful tooling made it manageable. The investment in learning Rust paid off with significantly more reliable and maintainable code, especially for the complex concurrent execution patterns required for effective reconnaissance automation.

**A Learning Journey**: My understanding of Rust is still in its baby steps‚ÄîI'm learning the language as I build this project. However, I'm committed to continuing this learning journey and evolving ipcrawler alongside my growing Rust knowledge. This project represents not just a tool for the cybersecurity community, but also a way to contribute back while learning. Every challenge overcome and feature added helps both my development as a programmer and provides value to fellow CTF players and security enthusiasts.
