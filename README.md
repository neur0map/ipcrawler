## üìã Requirements & Installation

### System Requirements
- **Python 3.8+**
- **Linux/macOS** (Windows via WSL--NOT FULLY TESTED)
- **Root privileges** (for SYN scanning and UDP)

### üö® Installation Options

<details>
<summary><b>‚ö° Automated Installation (Recommended)</b></summary>

The `make install` command automatically handles ALL dependencies and system setup:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/neur0map/ipcrawler.git
cd ipcrawler
make install
```

**What `make install` does:**
- Installs Python dependencies via pipx (isolated environment)
- Downloads and installs penetration testing tools
- Clones SecLists wordlists to `/usr/share/seclists` (or `~/tools/SecLists`)
- Adds tool binaries to system PATH
- Creates configuration directories

**‚ö†Ô∏è System Modifications Warning:**
This command modifies your system by installing packages and tools to:
- `/usr/local/bin/` - Tool binaries (gobuster, feroxbuster, etc.)
- `/usr/share/seclists/` - SecLists wordlist repository
- `/opt/` - Additional tools and resources
- System package manager (apt, brew, pacman)

**üîê Sudo Privileges Warning:**
The `make install` command automatically configures the `ipcrawler` command to run with sudo privileges. This means:
- **All scans run as root** - No password prompts, but full system access
- **UDP scans work automatically** - No "requires root privileges" errors
- **Automatic /etc/hosts modification** - Discovered hostnames added automatically on Kali/HTB systems
- **Security implications** - The tool has complete system access when running

This design choice eliminates the need to type `sudo ipcrawler` for every scan, but users should be aware that all enumeration runs with elevated privileges.

**Make Commands Available:**
- `make install` - Full installation with tools and dependencies
- `make clean` - Remove ipcrawler only (keeps tools and results)
- `make clean-all` - Remove everything including installed tools
- `make debug` - Show system diagnostics and tool availability
- `make help` - Show all available commands

</details>

<details>

---

## üîß Configuration

ipcrawler uses TOML configuration files for customization:

```toml
# ~/.config/ipcrawler/config.toml (Linux)
# ~/Library/Application Support/IPCrawler/config.toml (macOS)
verbose = 1
max-scans = 50
heartbeat = 30

[dirbuster]
tool = "feroxbuster"
threads = 20
wordlist = ["/usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt"]
```

### üìö Wordlist Configuration

ipcrawler automatically detects and configures wordlists from SecLists. The wordlist configuration is managed through a dedicated file:

**Configuration File Locations:**
- **Linux:** `~/.config/ipcrawler/wordlists.toml`
- **macOS:** `~/Library/Application Support/IPCrawler/wordlists.toml`
- **Shortcut:** `ipcrawler/wordlists/wordlists.toml` (symlink for easy access)

```toml
# Auto-generated wordlist configuration
[mode]
type = "auto"              # Use auto-detected SecLists paths
auto_update = true         # Update paths on each run

[custom_paths]
# Add your custom wordlist paths here
usernames = "/path/to/custom/usernames.txt"
passwords = "/path/to/custom/passwords.txt"
web_directories = "/path/to/custom/web-dirs.txt"
```

**Available wordlist categories:**
- `usernames` - User enumeration wordlists
- `passwords` - Password lists for brute force
- `web_directories` - Directory/file discovery
- `web_files` - Common web files
- `subdomains` - Subdomain enumeration
- `snmp_communities` - SNMP community strings
- `dns_servers` - DNS server lists
- `vhosts` - Virtual host discovery

**Override wordlists via command line:**
```bash
ipcrawler --wordlist-usernames /custom/users.txt target.com
ipcrawler --wordlist-web-directories /custom/dirs.txt target.com
```

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Missing Tools Error:**
```bash
[!] The following plugins failed checks that prevent ipcrawler from running: dirbuster
```

**Solutions:**
1. **Automated installation:** `make install` (installs all tools)
2. **Manual installation:** Install specific tools as shown in manual setup section
3. **Bypass checks:** `ipcrawler --ignore-plugin-checks target.com`

**SecLists Not Detected:**
```bash
[-] No SecLists installation detected. Using built-in wordlists where available.
```

**Solutions:**
1. **With make install:** Automatically clones SecLists to `/usr/share/seclists`
2. **Manual clone:** `git clone https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists.git ~/tools/SecLists`
3. **Package install:** `sudo apt install seclists` (may have different structure)

**Permission Issues:**
For UDP scanning and system-wide tool installation:
```bash
# For scanning
sudo ipcrawler target.com
# OR manual setup
sudo python3 ipcrawler.py target.com

# For make install (requires sudo for system modifications)
make install
```

**Restricted Environments:**
If you cannot install tools system-wide, use manual setup:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 ipcrawler.py target.com  # Runs with available tools only
```

**Tool Detection Failures:**
Check what tools are available:
```bash
make debug  # Shows comprehensive tool status
# OR manually
python3 ipcrawler.py -l  # List plugins (shows which need tools)
```
