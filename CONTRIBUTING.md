## üéØ Code Guidelines

### Python Style
```python
# Good: Clear, simple, documented
def analyze_service(port: int, service: str) -> List[str]:
    """Analyze service and return wordlist recommendations."""
    if not service:
        return []
    
    # Your logic here
    return recommendations

# Avoid: Complex one-liners, missing types
def analyze(p,s): return [] if not s else [w for w in get_wl() if match(w,s)]
```

### Adding New Workflows
1. Create directory: `workflows/your_workflow/`
2. Inherit from `BaseWorkflow`
3. Implement required methods:
```python
class YourWorkflow(BaseWorkflow):
    async def execute(self, context):
        # Your scanning logic
        pass
```

### Testing Changes

```bash
# Run the audit system
python ipcrawler.py --audit

# Test with a real target
python ipcrawler.py scanme.nmap.org

# Check for syntax errors
