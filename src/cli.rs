OVERVIEW:
  A powerful, flexible reconnaissance scanner that automates discovery of ports,
  services, vulnerabilities, and other network intelligence using industry-standard tools.

FEATURES:
  ‚úì Multi-format reports (JSON, HTML, Markdown, Text)
  ‚úì Interactive markdown summary viewing (with 'see' integration)
  ‚úì Generic parsing engine (works with any tool output)
  ‚úì Real-time discovery tracking with confidence scoring
  ‚úì Raw output preservation for manual analysis
  ‚úì Smart directory resolution (dev/production modes)
  ‚úì Template-driven output formatting

OUTPUT LOCATIONS:
  üìÅ Development Mode (when run from project):
     ‚Üí ./recon-results/{target}_{timestamp}/

  üìÅ Production Mode (system-wide installation):
     ‚Üí ~/Library/Application Support/io.recon-tool.recon-tool/results/{target}_{timestamp}/

  üìÑ Generated Reports:
     ‚Ä¢ scan_summary.json  - Structured data with raw outputs
     ‚Ä¢ scan_summary.html  - Interactive web report  
     ‚Ä¢ scan_summary.md    - Documentation format
     ‚Ä¢ scan_summary.txt   - Terminal-friendly summary

EXAMPLES:
  ipcrawler -t example.com                    # Basic scan with default config
  ipcrawler -t 192.168.1.1 -c network        # Network-focused scan
  ipcrawler -t example.com -o /tmp/scan/      # Custom output directory
  ipcrawler --paths                           # Show all directory paths
  ipcrawler --list                            # List available profiles
  ipcrawler --doctor                          # Check tool dependencies

ENHANCED FEATURES:
  üìñ Interactive Summary Viewing:
     After each scan, optionally view the markdown summary with the 'see' tool
     Opens in new terminal window (130x60) with syntax highlighting
     Install with: cargo install see-cat
