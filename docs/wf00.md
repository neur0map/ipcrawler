# Redirect Discovery Workflow (00)

**Quick hostname discovery and automatic /etc/hosts management for optimal scanning**

## 🎯 **Purpose**

This workflow solves the **"double-scan problem"** by discovering hostname redirects and automatically updating `/etc/hosts` BEFORE other workflows run, ensuring all subsequent scans (nmap, HTTP, gobuster, etc.) benefit from proper hostname resolution.

## ⚡ **What It Does**

### 1. **Quick HTTP Redirect Discovery** 
- Tests common HTTP/HTTPS ports (80, 443, 8080, 8443, 8000, 8888, 3000, 5000, 9000)
- Follows redirects using `curl -L` to discover hostnames
- Captures effective URLs and redirect chains
- **Execution Time**: ~5-15 seconds

### 2. **DNS Enumeration**
- Discovers common subdomains (www, api, mail, admin, dev, staging, etc.)
- Uses `nslookup` for reliable hostname resolution
- Maps discovered hostnames to IP addresses

### 3. **Automatic /etc/hosts Updates** (with sudo)
- **With sudo**: Automatically adds discovered IP/hostname mappings to `/etc/hosts`
- **Without sudo**: Reports discovered hostnames for manual review
- Creates backup (`/etc/hosts.ipcrawler.backup`)
- Smart cleanup of previous IPCrawler entries

## 🔄 **How It Solves the Double-Scan Problem**

### ❌ **Before (The Problem)**
```bash
# First scan: IP-based
nmap 192.168.1.100  # Misses virtual hosts
http_scan 192.168.1.100  # Limited results

# User manually adds to /etc/hosts
echo "192.168.1.100 app.domain.com" >> /etc/hosts

# Second scan: Hostname-based  
nmap app.domain.com  # Different results!
http_scan app.domain.com  # More services found
```

### ✅ **After (The Solution)**
```bash
# Workflow 00: Automatic hostname discovery + /etc/hosts update
# Workflows 01-03: All benefit from hostname mappings immediately
# Result: Single scan with complete results
```

## 🏗️ **Architecture Benefits**

### **Sequential Execution** 
```
00_redirect_discovery  ← Discovers hostnames, updates /etc/hosts
↓ /etc/hosts now contains all mappings
01_nmap_fast          ← Benefits from hostname resolution
↓
02_nmap_detailed      ← Benefits from hostname resolution  
↓
03_http_advanced      ← Benefits from hostname resolution
↓
04_gobuster (future)  ← Benefits from hostname resolution
```

### **System-Wide Impact**
- `/etc/hosts` modifications are **system-wide**
- **All subsequent tools** (nmap, curl, gobuster, etc.) automatically use hostname mappings
- **No configuration required** in other workflows
- **Works with any future workflow** that uses hostnames

## 📊 **Example Output**

### With Sudo (Optimal)
```bash
🔍 Quick Redirect Discovery - Mapping hostnames for optimal scanning
→ Testing common HTTP ports for redirects...
→ Performing DNS enumeration...
✓ Discovered 3 hostname mappings
✓ Added 3 entries to /etc/hosts
  → All subsequent workflows will benefit from hostname resolution
→ Proceeding to port discovery...
```

### Without Sudo (Informational)
```bash
🔍 Quick Redirect Discovery - Mapping hostnames for optimal scanning
→ Testing common HTTP ports for redirects...
→ Performing DNS enumeration...
✓ Discovered 3 hostname mappings
ℹ Discovered hostnames but no sudo privileges
  → Use 'sudo ipcrawler target' for automatic /etc/hosts updates
  → Subsequent workflows will use IP-based scanning
```

## 🔧 **Technical Details**

### **Dependencies**
- `curl` - For HTTP redirect following
- `nslookup` - For DNS resolution
- **Root privileges** (for /etc/hosts modification)

### **/etc/hosts Format**
```bash
# IPCrawler entries - auto-generated
192.168.1.100   app.domain.com
192.168.1.100   api.domain.com  
192.168.1.100   www.domain.com
# End IPCrawler entries
```

### **Cleanup & Safety**
- ✅ Creates automatic backup: `/etc/hosts.ipcrawler.backup`
- ✅ Smart cleanup of previous IPCrawler entries
- ✅ Graceful fallback if hostname discovery fails
- ✅ Non-blocking - other workflows continue even if this fails

## 🚀 **Performance Impact**

| Metric | Impact |
|---------|---------|
| **Execution Time** | +5-15 seconds (one-time cost) |
| **Subsequent Scans** | 50-80% more effective results |
| **Total Time Saved** | Eliminates need for manual double-scanning |
| **Accuracy Gain** | Discovers services missed by IP-only scans |

## 🔍 **Use Cases**

### **Perfect For:**
- Virtual host environments
- Cloud applications with multiple domains
- CDN-fronted applications
- Applications with hostname-based routing
- Modern web applications with redirects

### **Automatically Helps:**
- **Current workflows**: nmap_01, nmap_02, http_03
- **Future workflows**: gobuster, dirb, nikto, etc.
- **Manual tools**: Any tool that uses hostname resolution

## ⚙️ **Configuration**

The workflow respects the global privilege settings in `config.yaml`:

```yaml
privileges:
  prompt_for_sudo: true    # Ask user for escalation
  auto_escalate: false     # Auto-escalate in automation
```

No additional configuration required - works out of the box!
