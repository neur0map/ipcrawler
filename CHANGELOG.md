  - Server error messages and configuration pages
  - Link href attributes and form actions

### 📊 Enhanced - Progress Bar System
- **⏱️ Realistic Duration Estimates**: Updated with actual scan times:
  - Port scans: 15s → 60s (4x more realistic)
  - Nikto/Gobuster: 8s → 300s (5 minutes for web scans)
  - Nmap services: 8s → 120s (2 minutes)
  - Other services: 8s → 60s (1 minute)
- **📈 Asymptotic Progress Curve**: Continues advancing smoothly past estimated duration
  - Eliminated "stuck at 90%" issue using exponential decay to approach 98%
  - Provides realistic progress indication for long-running scans
- **🎯 Deduplication System**: Prevents multiple progress bars for same scan types
- **✨ Rich Visual Feedback**: Enhanced display with modern spinners and formatting

### 🎨 Enhanced - User Experience

- **📋 HTB Optimization**: Perfect integration for HackTheBox machines with `.htb` domains
- **⚡ Zero Interruption**: Scanning continues seamlessly after vhost discovery
- **🔍 Debug Information**: Enhanced verbosity levels for troubleshooting

### 🛠️ Technical Improvements
- **🧮 Mathematical Progress**: Exponential decay formula: `progress = 90% + 8% × (1 - e^(-overtime/60s))`
- **🔄 Concurrent Processing**: VHost detection runs parallel without performance impact
- **🛡️ Error Handling**: Robust handling for permission issues and network failures
- **📁 Code Organization**: New `VHostManager` class with clean separation of concerns

### 🎯 Use Cases

- **CTF Challenges**: Handles web applications with hostname-based routing
- **Enterprise Testing**: Manages complex virtual host configurations
- **OSCP Preparation**: Streamlined workflow for exam environments

### 💡 Configuration Options
```toml
[vhost_discovery]
enabled = true                    # Enable/disable vhost auto-discovery
backup_hosts_file = true         # Create backups before modification  
request_timeout = 10             # HTTP request timeout for discovery
user_agent = "ipcrawler-vhost-hunter/1.0"  # User agent for requests
```

### 🚨 Breaking Changes
- **None**: All changes are backwards compatible and opt-in based on environment detection

## [2.0.2] - 2025-06-13 🔄

### 🚀 DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOW OVERHAUL
**Fixed critical development workflow issues preventing proper git updates and code propagation**

### 🔧 Fixed - Development Infrastructure
- **Entry Point Confusion**: Fixed `make setup` to use correct development entry point
  - **Issue**: `ipcrawler-cmd` was calling `ipcrawler.py` instead of `ipcrawler/main.py` with proper `PYTHONPATH`
  - **Result**: Commands now properly execute development code instead of cached versions
- **Cache Override Problem**: Fixed Application Support cache overriding source code changes
  - **Issue**: `make setup` created cached files that ignored git updates
  - **Solution**: Enhanced `make update` to clean cached files and recreate symlinks to source
- **Git Update Propagation**: Fixed disconnect between `git pull` and running code
  - **Issue**: Users could run `git pull` but changes wouldn't take effect due to cached installations
  - **Solution**: `make update` now ensures all git changes become active immediately

### ✨ Enhanced - Update System
- **Smart Cache Management**: `make update` now automatically:
  - Stashes uncommitted changes before git pull
  - Cleans Application Support cached plugins
  - Recreates symlinks from cache to source code
  - Regenerates command scripts with latest code
  - Updates Python packages and system tools
  - Restores stashed changes after update
- **Config Migration**: Enhanced config handling to preserve user settings while updating
- **Backup Protection**: Automatically backs up user configs before cleaning cache

### 🎯 Enhanced - Tag Filtering System
- **Fixed `--list` Command**: Now properly applies tag filtering when showing available plugins
- **Tag Processing Logic**: Improved subset matching for complex tag combinations like `default+safe+quick`
- **Plugin Count Display**: Accurate active/excluded plugin counts in `--list` output
- **Performance Optimization**: Faster plugin filtering with proper tag subset logic

### 🛠️ Fixed - Plugin Infrastructure  
- **Path Quoting Issues**: Fixed wordlist paths with spaces in directory busting tools
  - **Affected**: feroxbuster, gobuster, dirsearch, ffuf, dirb commands
  - **Issue**: Paths like `/Users/.../Application Support/ipcrawler/wordlists/` failed due to unescaped spaces
  - **Solution**: Proper path quoting in all plugin command generation
- **Duplicate Plugin Prevention**: Disabled conflicting `all-tcp-ports` scanner to prevent duplicate scans
- **Plugin Symlink Management**: Fixed plugin loading to use source code instead of cached copies

### 📋 Enhanced - User Workflow
- **Clear Update Process**: Users can now safely use standard git workflow:
  ```bash
  git pull           # Gets latest source code  
  make update        # Cleans cache, updates everything, activates changes
  ```
- **Development Mode**: Enhanced developer experience with proper source code execution
- **Tool Installation**: Improved missing tool detection and installation suggestions

### 🔍 Technical Improvements
- **Entry Point Standardization**: All execution paths now use proper development entry points
- **Configuration Consistency**: Unified config loading between development and installed versions
- **Error Handling**: Better error messages for setup and update operations
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Enhanced macOS and Linux support for development workflow

## [2.0.1] - 2025-06-13 🐛

### 🐛 CRITICAL BUG FIXES
**Fixed major plugin check issues that were preventing plugins from running with default tags**

### 🔧 Fixed
- **Plugin Check Logic**: Fixed missing `return True` statements in multiple plugin `check()` methods
  - Fixed: `dnsrecon`, `redis-cli`, `dnsrecon-subdomain-bruteforce`, `enum4linux`, `oracle-scanner`, `oracle-tnscmd`
  - **Impact**: Plugins with available tools were incorrectly failing checks and not running
  - **Result**: Plugins now properly pass checks when their required tools are installed
- **Progress Bar Exception**: Fixed `IndexError` in ProgressManager when tasks were removed during updates
  - Added proper error handling and task existence checks in `_progress_updater()`
  - **Impact**: Eliminated random crashes during progress bar updates
  - **Result**: Smooth progress bar operation without exceptions
- **Directory Buster Auto-Detection**: Enhanced dirbuster plugin to automatically detect available tools
  - Auto-switches from `feroxbuster` → `ffuf` → `dirsearch` → `gobuster` → `dirb`
  - **Impact**: Directory busting now works with `--tags default` when any compatible tool is available
  - **Result**: Improved plugin compatibility across different systems

### 📈 Improvements
- **Plugin Resilience**: All plugins now handle tool availability checks correctly
- **Better Error Messages**: Enhanced plugin error reporting with installation suggestions
- **System Compatibility**: Improved cross-platform tool detection and usage

## [1.1.4] - 2025-01-12 🛠️

### 🛠️ Plugin & Backup Improvements
- **Fixed Plugin Loading**: Resolved "datetime not a subclass" error by filtering out imported classes from plugin validation
- **Enhanced Backup Location**: VHost /etc/hosts backups now stored in target scan directory instead of /etc/ (survives terminal closure)
- **Improved Plugin Validation**: Plugin loader now only validates classes defined in plugin files, not imported dependencies
- **Better Backup Persistence**: Backup files stored in `results/IP/hosts.backup.timestamp` for easy access and restoration

---

## [1.1.3] - 2025-01-12 🔥

### 🔥 HOTFIX - Critical IP Extraction Bug
- **CRITICAL**: Fixed IP extraction logic to use parent directory instead of scan directory name
- **Root Cause**: VHost post-processor was extracting IP from "scans" directory instead of parent target directory
- **Impact**: Now correctly adds `10.10.11.68 planning.htb` instead of `scans planning.htb` to /etc/hosts
- **Directory Structure**: Properly handles ipcrawler's structure: `results/IP/scans/` → extracts IP from parent directory

---

---

## [1.1.1] - 2025-06-12 🔧

### 🐛 Fixed
- **VHost Discovery Priority**: VHost Redirect Hunter now runs before Virtual Host Enumeration (priority 10 vs 5)
- **Post-Processing Path Resolution**: Fixed post-processor to correctly scan all target directories instead of single 'scans' directory
- **File Detection Logic**: Enhanced VHost file discovery to properly locate `vhost_redirects_*.txt` files in target subdirectories
